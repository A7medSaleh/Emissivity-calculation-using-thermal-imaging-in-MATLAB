This code calculates the emissivity using infrared thermal imaging for the same object in two different temperatures using the raw data from thermal camera like FLIR or any other camera along with the calculated temperature, emissivity can be calculated at each point in the image.

After radiance (raw data) and temperature is extracted using the thermal camera the data is loaded as CSV files to matlab code to process it and calculate the emisssivity correction map.
